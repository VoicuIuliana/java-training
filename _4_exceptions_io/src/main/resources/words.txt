A letter is a written message conveyed from one person
 (or group of people) to another through a medium.[clarification needed][1] The term usually
  excludes written material intended to be read in its original form by large numbers of people,
   such as newspapers and placards; however even these may include material in the form of an

   istorically, letters have existed from the times of ancient India, ancient Egypt and Sumer,
   through Rome, Greece and China, up to the present day. During the 17th and 18th centuries,

   to send a communication, by sending it between distant points as an electrical signal. At the telegraph office closest
    to the destination, the signal was converted back into writing on paper and delivered to the recipient. The next ste
